This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in COBOL loops and its solution. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version. The error arises from an incorrectly defined loop termination condition, causing the loop to iterate one time less than intended.
